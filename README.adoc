== Target Audience

* This Address Book application is primarily designed with University students in mind.
* Problems:
** In a Univesity setting, there are many opportunities for collaboration. However, with the multitude of collaboration platforms available (e.g. Slack, Telegram, Github etc.), collecting user information for individual platforms quickly becomes tedious.
** Beyond work-related collaborations, University is also a place for expanding one's social network. However, the context does not often provide an opportunity for group mates to request for each other's social profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook etc.)
* Solution:
** Address Book Pro aims to be a unified platform where users can collect all important information of their group mates, all in one go.
** Address Book Pro also provides an easy-access to group mates' social media profiles, which serves to faciliate networking.
